        OFFERING CONTEXT:
        "{my_offering}"
        
        CRITICAL RULES:
        1. MESSAGE LENGTH: ALL platform messages (LinkedIn, WhatsApp, SMS, Instagram) MUST be 4-5 lines minimum (not counting greeting/signature).
           - Each message should be comprehensive and compelling. Do NOT generate 1-liners.
        2. NO FLUFF: Don't just list facts. Weave them into a narrative. 
        3. INTEGRATION: You must fluidly bridge the prospect's specific details (pain points, recent activity) with the 'OFFERING CONTEXT'. Do not just paste the offering; explain *why* it matters to *them*.
        4. TONE: Professional yet conversational.
        5. CALL TO ACTION: Clear next step.
